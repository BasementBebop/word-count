I searched through after creating my github repository and could not get
a way to work where I would add a license (yes I was stupid and chose to
just ignore where I was supposed to choose one).

This program takes a string object and a string argument as input and
counts the instances of the argument inside the object. Before doing this
it takes all common symbols out of the object.
